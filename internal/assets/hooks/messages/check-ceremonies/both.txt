Your last 3 sessions didn't use /ctx-remember or
/ctx-wrap-up.

Start sessions with:  /ctx-remember
  → Loads context, shows active tasks, picks up
    where you left off. No re-explaining needed.

End sessions with:    /ctx-wrap-up
  → Captures learnings and decisions so the next
    session starts informed, not from scratch.

These take seconds and save minutes.
