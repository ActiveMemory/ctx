# pd-m3 Plan — the mover (append → verify → remove + gist write-back)

**Spec:** `specs/progressive-disclosure.md` · **Status:** Ready
**Blocking TBDs resolved:** none block M3.
- Gist format — resolved **in the spec** (`### Gist format`): one bullet
  `- <name> — <gist> → [<name>](<noun>/<slug>.md)`. Consumed here, not
  re-litigated.
- CONVENTIONS `##`-vs-`###` digestion — **deferrable**, graduates to
  blocking at **M4**. The M3 mover handles entry kinds only (learning,
  decision) and **refuses** the convention kind (`ErrApplyNotEntryKind`).
- Suggest-only trigger wiring — **deferrable**, M5.

## Scope & DoD

Milestone 3 delivers **the mover**: the first pass that *writes* canonical
knowledge files. It moves staged entries into per-theme tier-1 files and
folds their gists into the root's `## Themes`, under the spec's guards
(append → verify byte-presence → remove; validate precondition; crash
ordering additive-first, single root rewrite last; fail loud, no
auto-repair). It consumes the `Plan` the `ctx-digest` skill authors from
the M2 `Inspection`.

Entry kinds only. CONVENTIONS digestion stays M4 (its `##`-section model
collides with the region delimiters — pd-m1/pd-m2 amendments).

**The write path is guarded by code, not by agent discipline.** The M1
clobber-bug rationale ("never regenerate from what I recognized") means
the mover must not trust the skill to move files safely — the skill
supplies *semantics* (theme assignment + gist prose); the `Apply`
mechanism enforces *safety* (validate, lossless byte-cut, verify, order).

DoD (confirmed by measurement or by the user — never derived from task
completion):

- [ ] `make lint` = 0 issues, `go test ./...` green, `make audit` passes
- [ ] `disclosure.Apply` moves staged entries to theme files with
      append→verify→remove ordering; on any theme-write/verify failure the
      **root file is byte-identical** to before (T06)
- [ ] **Conservation** on a driven fixture: `entryIDs(staging_before) ==
      moved ⊎ entryIDs(staging_after)` (disjoint union); every moved entry
      byte-present in **exactly one** theme file; zero loss, zero dups (T09)
- [ ] **Idempotency**: `Apply` with an empty plan (or empty staging) is a
      no-op; root byte-identical (T07)
- [ ] Post-apply, all four invariants pass on the result — `Validate`,
      `CheckPairing`, `CheckUniqueness`, `CheckLinks` (T08)
- [ ] **Gist write-back**: a touched/new theme's bullet is
      (re)written in `## Themes`; untouched theme bullets are **byte-preserved**
      (T03, T08); first run on an un-migrated root **creates** `## Themes`
      below staging (T07)
- [ ] `ctx disclosure apply <root> --plan <p.json>` performs the move and
      reports what it did; refuses non-knowledge files and the convention
      kind, leaving the file untouched (T10–T12)
- [ ] The `ctx-digest` skill, driven on a realistic fixture, completes a
      full apply that moves entries and writes gists — the milestone's
      **measurement gate** (T16)
- [ ] Real `.context/LEARNINGS.md` → `.context/DECISIONS.md` rollout is
      performed and verified **only on explicit user sign-off** (T17,
      human-gated)

## Data model & storage

No state file — staging **is** the watermark (DECISION `[2026-07-16-215955]`).
New value types in `internal/disclosure` (`apply.go`/`types.go`):

```go
// Plan is the digest plan the ctx-digest skill authors and Apply
// executes: per target theme, which staged entries move there and the
// gist to write. Entry identity is timestamp+title (IDSeparator-joined),
// matching entryIDs / CheckUniqueness.
type Plan struct {
    Kind        string       `json:"kind"`        // "learning" | "decision"
    Assignments []Assignment `json:"assignments"`
}
type Assignment struct {
    Theme   string   `json:"theme"`   // theme name (bullet label + heading text)
    Slug    string   `json:"slug"`    // theme-file basename stem → <noun>/<slug>.md
    Gist    string   `json:"gist"`    // authored one-line gist (spec ### Gist format)
    Entries []string `json:"entries"` // entry IDs to move here, in file order
}

// ApplyResult reports a successful Apply, for CLI output.
type ApplyResult struct {
    Moved  int      `json:"moved"`  // entries moved
    Themes []string `json:"themes"` // theme slugs created or appended
}
```

**Storage layout** (unchanged from spec): theme files at
`<ctxDir>/<noun>/<slug>.md`, `<noun>` ∈ {`learnings`,`decisions`} via the
`cfgDisc.ThemeDir*` constants. Root rewritten in place.

**Theme-file body format:** on create, `# <Theme>\n\n` + the moved entry
spans; on append, `<existing>\n\n` + the moved spans. The exact separator
is unconstrained by conservation (which checks entry *presence*, not file
bytes); byte-presence verify uses `strings.Contains(fileContent, span)`.

## Contracts

**Disclosure package additions** (`internal/disclosure`):

- `ThemeDir(k Kind) (string, bool)` — Kind → `learnings`/`decisions`
  subdir; `(_, false)` for convention (mover refuses it) and unknown.
- `SplitStaging(staging string, moveIDs []string) (moved map[string]string, remaining string, err error)`
  — the **lossless byte-cut**. Computes each entry's *untrimmed*
  header-to-next-header span over raw `staging` (NOT via
  `heading.ParseEntryBlocks`, which trims trailing blanks and is lossy —
  it is used only for *identity*). Returns each moved id → its verbatim
  span and the remaining staging byte-exact. `ErrEntryNotInStaging` for an
  unknown id; `ErrEntryAssignedTwice` for a repeated id.
- `verifyContains(fileContent, span string) error` — pure predicate;
  `ErrVerifyFailed` when `span` is absent. The byte-presence guard.
- `WriteThemeBullet(themesRaw string, a Assignment, hadThemes bool) string`
  — gist write-back over **raw** `## Themes` text: replace the bullet line
  whose parsed name == `a.Theme`, else append a new bullet; create the
  `## Themes` heading when `!hadThemes`. Untouched bullet lines are
  preserved verbatim (spec: "leave untouched themes alone"). Renders
  `- <theme> — <gist> → [<theme>](<noun>/<slug>.md)` using
  `token.PrefixListDash`, `token.MetaSeparator`, `cfgDisc.ThemeArrow`
  (new const `" → "`), `cfgDisc.LinkOpen`.
- `Apply(rootPath string, plan Plan, ctxDir string) (ApplyResult, error)`
  — the IO mover. Order (spec Guards §1,§3):
  1. Read+`Parse` (kind via `KindFor(basename)`); refuse convention/
     unknown kind (`ErrApplyNotEntryKind`).
  2. `Validate(root)` — refuse malformed, no write (Guard §2).
  3. Validate the plan against staging via `SplitStaging` (fail loud on
     unknown/duplicate ids; `ErrEmptyAssignment` for an assignment with no
     entries).
  4. **Additive first:** for each assignment, append its moved spans to
     `<ctxDir>/<noun>/<slug>.md` (mkdir + create if new).
  5. **Verify:** re-read each written theme file; `verifyContains` every
     moved span. Any miss → abort (`ErrVerifyFailed`), **root untouched**.
  6. Fold gists: `WriteThemeBullet` per assignment over `root.ThemesRaw`.
  7. **Single root rewrite, last:** write `preamble + remaining + newThemes`
     to `rootPath`. This is the only root write; reached only after every
     verify passes, so any earlier failure leaves the root byte-identical.
  Fail-loud, no auto-repair. Worst-case crash = duplicated theme append
  (recoverable), never loss.

**CLI** (`ctx disclosure apply <file> --plan <path|->`):

- New subcommand under the existing `disclosure` group (registered in
  `internal/cli/disclosure/disclosure.go` alongside `inspect.Cmd()`).
  `Use`/`DescKey` constants in `config/embed/cmd`.
- Reads `--plan` (file path, or `-` for stdin) as JSON `Plan`, resolves
  ctxDir, calls `disclosure.Apply`, renders `ApplyResult` (human + `--json`
  via `internal/write/disclosure`). Kind-inference / convention refusal →
  typed sentinel, non-zero exit, **no write**.

**Skill** (`internal/assets/claude/skills/ctx-digest/SKILL.md`):

- Extend from dry-run-only to the **apply** path. After the human approves
  the proposed plan (M2 flow unchanged through step 4): write the `Plan`
  JSON → run `ctx disclosure apply <root> --plan <plan.json>` → re-run
  `ctx disclosure inspect` to confirm staging shrank and themes grew.
  The human gates the apply explicitly (skill presents the plan and asks
  before invoking). States conventions are deferred to M4. Copilot copy
  synced via `make sync-copilot-skills`.

No `ctx agent` change (spec Non-Goals). No `add`-path change.

## Epic anchors (TASKS.md projection)

Epics **partition** the task ids:

| Epic | Range | Count |
|---|---|---|
| E1 Mover core (disclosure package) | T01–T09 | 9 |
| E2 `ctx disclosure apply` CLI | T10–T13 | 4 |
| E3 Apply skill, rollout, gate | T14–T18 | 5 |

Arithmetic: 9 + 4 + 5 = **18** = the task count. No id double-counted or
unclaimed. **Completion rule:** an epic is `[x]` in TASKS.md only when
every task in its range is `[x]`/`[o]` here.

## Risks & measurement gates

- **⚠️ T16 is the milestone's measurement gate.** If a full driven apply
  cannot move entries losslessly with gists on a realistic fixture, the
  mover design is wrong and must be reconsidered before touching real
  canonical files (T17).
- **T17 mutates canonical `.context/` files** — the payoff, and the
  clobber-risk class the M1 guards exist for. It is **human-gated**: run
  only on explicit user approval, verify conservation + invariants before
  committing, and land it as its own commit. The code (T01–T16) is
  complete and verifiable **independent of T17**.
- **Lossless byte-cut is the fault line.** `heading.ParseEntryBlocks`
  trims trailing blank lines (`internal/heading/entry.go`), so re-joining
  parsed blocks is lossy. `SplitStaging` must operate on raw
  header-to-next-header spans; T02's byte-exact assertion is what proves
  it. Using `ParseEntryBlocks` for the *cut* (not just identity) would
  silently drop inter-entry whitespace.
- **`parseThemeBullet` folds the `→ [link]` tail into `Theme.Gist`**
  (M2 parse quirk — the parsed `Gist` retains the arrow+link suffix).
  M3 sidesteps it by editing **raw** bullet lines (`WriteThemeBullet`),
  never re-rendering from the parsed `Theme`. Noted, not fixed here (M2
  surface; not blocking).
- **Verify-miss is defensive.** After a successful append, byte-presence
  always holds, so the true miss branch is only reachable via IO
  corruption. T06 proves the guard two ways: the pure `verifyContains`
  predicate (miss → `ErrVerifyFailed`) and the ordering property (append
  failure → root untouched).

## Out of scope (deferred, with pointers)

| Deferred | Milestone | Note |
|---|---|---|
| CONVENTIONS digestion (`##` section model) | M4 | mover refuses `convention` kind (`ErrApplyNotEntryKind`); `##`-vs-`###` TBD is blocking there |
| Suggest-only trigger wiring (growth nudge, /ctx-remember, /ctx-wrap-up) | M5 | nudge-threshold TBD blocking there |
| `--dry-run` on `apply` | — | dry-run already covered by `inspect` + the skill's propose step (M2); not needed |
| Nesting / theme taxonomy | — | structure self-similar; deferred indefinitely (spec Non-Goals) |
| `ctx drift` wiring beyond the existing path check | — | spec does not require it |
