## `ctx`

`ctx` (*Context*) is a file-based system that enables AI coding assistants to
persist project knowledge across sessions. Instead of re-explaining your
codebase every time, context files let AI tools remember decisions,
conventions, and learnings:

* A session is interactive.
* `ctx` enables **cognitive continuity**.
* **Cognitive continuity** enables durable, *symbiotic-like* human–AI workflows.

!!! quote "The `ctx` Manifesto"
    **Creation, not code. Context, not prompts. Verification, not vibes.**

    Without durable context, intelligence resets.
    With `ctx`, creation compounds.

## Community

**Open source is better together**.

    **If the idea behind `ctx` resonates, a star helps it reach engineers
    who run into context drift every day.**

    `ctx` is free and open source software, and **contributions are always
    welcome** and appreciated.

## Why?

Most AI-driven development fails not because models are weak—they fail because
**context is ephemeral**. Every new session starts near zero:

* You re-explain architecture
* The AI repeats past mistakes
* Decisions get rediscovered instead of remembered

`ctx` solves this by treating context as **infrastructure**:
files that version with your code and persist across sessions.
