# Archived Tasks - 2026-02-14

- [x] `/ctx-remember` slash command: single command that triggers the full
      "reload and present" session-start ritual. Runs `ctx agent --budget 4000`,
      lists last 3 session files, presents structured readback template.
      42% of sessions start with a memory check; current behavior is
      instruction-dependent and sometimes fails. #priority:high #source:report-1
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] Enhanced `/ctx-save`: produce richer session summaries instead of
      empty auto-save stubs. Should include: key topics discussed, files
      modified, decisions/learnings added, commits created, suggested tasks
      for next session. 2025-era manual saves show what rich summaries look
      like vs current empty stubs. #priority:high #source:report-1
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] `/ctx-next` slash command: "what should I work on next?" Reads TASKS.md,
      identifies unblocked high-priority items, cross-references recent session
      activity to avoid re-doing work, suggests 1-3 next actions with rationale.
      49 task-review prompts found across sessions. #priority:medium #source:report-1
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] `/ctx-commit` slash command: commit-with-context workflow. Runs standard
      commit workflow, then prompts "Any decisions or learnings to record?"
      and optionally runs `/ctx-reflect`. Connects the 120 commit sequences
      with context persistence. #priority:medium #source:report-1
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] `make check` target: single entry point for build + test + lint cycle.
      311 build-then-test sequences found; agent frequently runs raw `go build`
      and `go test` instead of using Makefile. Alternatively, enhance `/qa`
      to include the build step. #priority:medium #source:report-1
      **Done**: `make check` = `build` + `audit` (fmt, vet, lint, drift,
      docs, test). #done:2026-02-08
- [x] `/ctx-implement` slash command: accepts a plan document (inline or file
      path), breaks it into checkable subtasks, executes each step with
      build/test verification between steps, reports progress. 31 plan-
      implementation prompts found, but agents handle this well already
      with raw prompts. #priority:low #source:report-1
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] Post-commit doc drift reminder: hook or convention that suggests
      `/update-docs` after commits touching source code. Existing `/update-docs`
      covers the need, just needs prompting integration — could be part of
      `/ctx-commit` workflow. #priority:low #source:report-1
      **Done**: Added as step 4 in `/ctx-commit` — conditionally suggests
      `/update-docs` when source files are committed. #done:2026-02-08
- [x] Update user-facing documentation for all of the above skills and use cases.
- [x] create "use-case-based" user-facing documentation (the problem, how
      ctx solves it, typical workflow, best practices, gotchas, etc.)
- [x] Remove prompt-coach hook — delivery mechanism doesn't work (stdout goes to AI not user, stderr is invisible, no viable user-facing channel). Zero useful tips fired across all usage. Creates orphan temp files via L-3 PID bug. The prompting guide already covers best practices. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-12-005504 #done:2026-02-12
- [x] BUG: SessionEnd hook ["$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/.claude/hooks/auto-save-session.sh] failed: /bin/sh: line 1: /home/jose/WORKSPACE/ctx/.claude/hooks/auto-save-session.sh: No such file or directory
      **Done**: Resolved by GH-7 session simplification — auto-save hook removed entirely. #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Add git worktree recipe to documentation: parallel agent development
      using worktrees for independent task tracks. Cover setup (worktree
      creation as sibling dirs), task grouping by blast radius, launching
      separate claude sessions, merging back, cleanup. Include the 3-4
      worktree practical limit and the "don't run ctx init in worktrees"
      gotcha. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-12
      **Done**: `docs/recipes/parallel-worktrees.md` created and linked in index. #done:2026-02-14
- [x] Create `/ctx-worktree` skill: wrap git worktree commands with
      ctx-aware guardrails (max 4 worktrees, sibling dirs, work/ branch
      prefix, no ctx init reminder, TASKS.md conflict guidance, task
      grouping by blast radius). Skill only — no Go code changes needed.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-14
      **Done**: `.claude/skills/ctx-worktree/SKILL.md` with all 6 guardrails,
      embedded in template for deployment via `ctx init`. #done:2026-02-14
- [x] Fix `internal/cli/recall/doc.go`: replace stale `serve` subcommand
      with `export`, remove "(Phase 3)" annotation. Godoc shows a command
      that doesn't exist. #priority:high #source:report-2 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Fix `internal/claude/doc.go`: change stale `tpl/commands/*.md` to
      `claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, add `prompt-coach.sh` and
      `check-context-size.sh` to embedded assets list. #priority:medium #source:report-2
      #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Fix `internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go:44-46` godoc: add 5 missing
      subcommands (decision, learnings, recall, journal, serve) or replace
      with "all ctx subcommands" to avoid future drift. #priority:medium #source:report-2
      #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Fix `internal/cli/hook/run.go` Claude Code example: update stale
      `preToolCall` JSON key to `PreToolUse` with nested matcher
      structure. #priority:medium #source:report-2 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Add doc.go files for packages lacking documentation: `status`,
      `sync`, `watch`, `serve`, `config`, `validation`. #priority:low #source:report-2
      #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Fix package comment mismatch: `internal/cli/decision/decision.go:7`
      says "Package decisions" but package is `decision`. #priority:low #source:report-2
      #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Add `Context.File(name string)` method to eliminate 10+ linear scan
      boilerplate instances across 5 packages. Low effort, high
      impact. #priority:high #source:report-3 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Extract `findSessions(allProjects bool)` helper in `recall/run.go`:
      identical 20-line block duplicated in 3 functions. #priority:high #source:report-3
      #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Extract `deployHookScript()` helper in `initialize/hook.go`:
      4 nearly identical copy-paste blocks for hook script creation.
      Reduces 103 lines to ~30. #priority:medium #source:report-3
      #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Move utility functions from `recall/run.go` to `recall/fmt.go`:
      formatDuration, formatTokens, stripLineNumbers, extractSystemReminders,
      normalizeCodeFences, formatToolUse. Brings run.go from 649 to
      ~490 lines. #priority:medium #source:report-3 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Convert `formatToolUse` switch (recall/run.go:596) to dispatch map:
      45-line switch becomes 10-line `map[string]string`
      lookup. #priority:low #source:report-3 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Split `config/tpl.go` (401 lines) - by feature area: tpl_entry.go,
      tpl_journal.go, tpl_recall.go, tpl_loop.go. #priority:medium
      #source:report-3 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] Unify task archiving logic: 3 separate implementations in
      task/run.go, compact/task.go, drift/fix.go. Create shared
      archive helper. #priority:medium #source:report-3 #done:2026-02-11
- [x] L-5: Remove or secure debug logging in `block-git-push.sh`:
      appends all intercepted git commands to world-readable
      `/tmp/claude-hook-debug.log`. #priority:low #source:report-4
      **Done**: Debug logging removed from both deployed and template versions. #done:2026-02-14
- [x] Blog: "ctx v0.3.0: The Discipline Release" -- release post anchoring
      timeline, covers commands-to-skills migration, skill sweep,
      consolidation, backup/monitoring infra. #priority:high #source:report-5
      **Done**: Draft in ideas/blog-draft-2026-02-09-the-discipline-release.md
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] Blog: "The 3:1 Ratio" -- formalize the consolidation ratio with
      evidence from git history, connect to /consolidate skill and
      convention drift patterns. #priority:medium #source:report-5
      **Done**: Draft in ideas/blog-draft-2026-02-10-the-3-1-ratio.md
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] Blog: "Hooks: The Invisible Infrastructure" -- deep dive on hook
      ecosystem, bugs, $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR migration, repetition fatigue,
      cooldown mechanism. #priority:medium #source:report-5
      **Done**: Draft in ideas/blog-draft-2026-02-11-hooks-the-invisible-infrastructure.md
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] Blog: "Context as Infrastructure" -- synthesis piece, broadest
      audience, elevates attention budget theory into thesis about
      persistent context. #priority:low #source:report-5
      **Done**: Draft in ideas/blog-draft-2026-02-12-context-as-infrastructure.md
      #done:2026-02-08
- [x] P3.1: Create `internal/crypto/` package — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt,
      key generation (256-bit via `crypto/rand`), file format
      `[12-byte nonce][ciphertext+tag]`. Go stdlib only, no external deps.
      Include comprehensive tests (round-trip, wrong key, corrupted data,
      empty plaintext). **Read `specs/scratchpad.md` before starting any
      P3 task.** #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.2: Add config constants — `FileScratchpadEnc`, `FileScratchpadMd`,
      `FileScratchpadKey`, `PermSecret = 0600` in `internal/config/`.
      Add `ScratchpadEncrypt bool` field to `internal/rc/types.go`
      (default true). #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.3: Wire into `ctx init` — generate key (0600), gitignore it,
      create empty encrypted scratchpad. Skip if key exists (idempotent).
      Warn if `.enc` exists but no key. Respect `scratchpad_encrypt`
      config for plaintext fallback. Print key path on creation (never
      print key content). #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.4: Create `internal/cli/pad/` package — cobra command with
      subcommands: `list` (default), `add`, `rm`, `edit`, `mv`.
      Register in `bootstrap.go`. Add `doc.go`. #priority:high
      #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.5: Implement `ctx pad` (list) — decrypt, number entries 1-based,
      print to stdout. Handle: empty scratchpad, missing key, wrong key,
      missing file. #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.5a: Add `ctx pad show N` subcommand — output raw text of entry N with
      no numbering, no prefix, no trailing newline decoration. Enables unix pipe
      composability: `ctx pad edit 1 --append "$(ctx pad show 3)"`.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-14 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.6: Implement `ctx pad add "..."` — decrypt, append line,
      re-encrypt. Create scratchpad file on first add if not exists.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.7: Implement `ctx pad rm N` — decrypt, remove entry at position N,
      re-encrypt. Validate index bounds. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.8: Implement `ctx pad edit N "..."` — decrypt, replace entry at
      position N, re-encrypt. Validate index bounds. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.8a: Add `--append` and `--prepend` flags to `ctx pad edit N` — instead
      of replacing the entire entry, `--append "text"` concatenates to the end
      and `--prepend "text"` concatenates to the beginning. Flags are mutually
      exclusive with the positional replacement text. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-14 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.9: Implement `ctx pad mv N M` — decrypt, move entry from position
      N to position M, re-encrypt. Validate both indices. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.10: Implement `ctx pad resolve` — detect git merge conflict on
      scratchpad file, decrypt both sides (ours/theirs), output both
      numbered lists. Used by skill for interactive merge. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.11: Create `/ctx-pad` skill (`SKILL.md`) — wraps `ctx pad`
      commands. Maps natural language to CLI (add, rm, edit, mv, list).
      `allowed-tools: Bash(ctx:*)`. #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.12: Add `"Bash(ctx pad:*)"` to `DefaultClaudePermissions` in
      `internal/config/file.go`. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.13: Unit tests for `internal/crypto/` — encrypt/decrypt round-trip,
      wrong key rejection, corrupted ciphertext, empty input, large input.
      **Done**: 9 test functions in crypto_test.go, all passing.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.14: Unit tests for `internal/cli/pad/` — all commands, index
      bounds, missing file, missing key, plaintext mode.
      **Done**: 28+ test functions in pad_test.go (590 lines), all passing.
      #priority:high #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.15: Integration test — `ctx init` → `ctx pad add` → `ctx pad` →
      `ctx pad rm` → verify encrypted file is opaque, plaintext fallback
      works. **Done**: Covered by pad_test.go which exercises full
      init→add→list→rm flows in both encrypted and plaintext modes.
      #priority:medium #added:2026-02-13 #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.16: Add scratchpad section to user-facing documentation — what it
      is, encrypted by default, how to use, key distribution (copy the
      file), `.contextrc` plaintext override. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-13
      **Done**: `docs/scratchpad.md` — feature docs page with all 9 commands,
      encryption details, key distribution, plaintext override, decision table. #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.17: Add scratchpad recipe — "Syncing sensitive notes across
      machines": init on machine A, copy key to machine B, push/pull
      workflow, what to do on merge conflict. #priority:medium
      #added:2026-02-13
      **Done**: `docs/recipes/scratchpad-sync.md` — 5-step workflow, merge
      conflict walkthrough, conversational resolution example. #done:2026-02-14
- [x] P3.18: Add scratchpad recipe — "Using the scratchpad with Claude":
      example skill interactions, natural language examples, when to use
      scratchpad vs context files. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-13
      **Done**: `docs/recipes/scratchpad-with-claude.md` — 6-step workflow,
      natural language mapping table, decision guide. #done:2026-02-14
- [x] Check for the latest backup of .context (there is a script in ~/WORKSPACE)
  and if it is >2days old, remind the user to run the backup script.
  we can use a hook for this. Alternative could be detecting this,
  exiting early, and using a cron job; but the disadvantage is, if nothing has
  changed, the cron job will still make a redundant backup: If nobody is using
  the project, then there is no need to run the backup anyway.
  **Done**: UserPromptSubmit hook (check-backup-age.sh) checks marker file age
  and SMB mount status. Backup script moved to hack/backup-context.sh with env
  vars (CTX_BACKUP_SMB_URL). All hook paths migrated to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR.
  `make backup` target added. #done:2026-02-05
- [x] Build minimal ctx monitor dashboard (see specs/monitor-architecture.md).
  - [x] MVP: a terminal script that runs in a separate window, finds the active
    session JSONL, estimates token usage, shows context health (green/yellow/red),
    and refreshes periodically. Later: pluggable auditors
    (drift, repetition detection), signal injection via hooks. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-04-223356
  **Rescoped**: Full dashboard deferred. Instead: check-context-size.sh hook
  with adaptive frequency + ctx-context-monitor skill for in-session awareness.
  context-watch.sh kept as-is for manual terminal monitoring. Repetition
  detection shelved (low ROI, user notices loops faster). #done:2026-02-05
  - [x] Deploy context-watch.sh to .context/tools/ via ctx init. Embedded in
    binary, deployed with 0755 permissions by createTools() in initialize.
    #done:2026-02-06
- [x] Search for a consolidation/code-hygiene skill that can enforce
  project-specific conventions. Today's codebase scan found concrete
  drift: 5 Is* predicate violations, magic strings in 7+ files, 80+ hardcoded
  file permissions. A skill that periodically checks for ctx's known drift
  patterns (godoc style, predicate naming, file organization, magic strings
  in config) would be the enforcement arm of CONVENTIONS.md. Look for skills
  focused on codebase consistency, convention enforcement, or technical debt
  scanning — not generic code review checklists. #priority:medium #added:2026-02-04-222224
  **Done**: Found generic skill (70% redundant per E/A/R), adapted to
  `/consolidate` with 9 project-specific checks. Added line width +
  duplication conventions. Blog post drafted. #completed:2026-02-05
- [x] Fix block-non-path-ctx.sh hook: too aggressive matching blocks git -C path commands that don't invoke ctx #added:2026-02-07-211544
      **Done**: Anchored patterns to command position (start of line or after `&&`, `;`, `||`, `|`).
      Split `^` out of alternation groups since grep -E doesn't anchor `^` inside `(^|...)`. #done:2026-02-12
- [x] GH-7: Session/journal architecture simplification. Three overlapping
      storage layers (`.claude/projects/`, `.context/sessions/`, `.context/journal/`)
      with redundancy. `.context/sessions/` is a dead end -- nothing reads from it.
      **Done**: Eliminated `.context/sessions/` entirely. Deleted `internal/cli/session/`
      (15 files), removed auto-save hook, removed `--auto-save` from watch, removed
      pre-compact auto-save, removed `/ctx-save` skill, updated ~45 docs. Two stores
      remain: raw transcripts (`~/.claude/projects/`) and enriched journal
      (`.context/journal/`). See DECISIONS.md. #done:2026-02-11
